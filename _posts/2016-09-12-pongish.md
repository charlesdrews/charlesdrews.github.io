Remember that classic paddles & bouncing ball game? This new take isn't the
original, but it's clean, fast, fun, and it's Pong... ish :)

For my first game I decided to build a simple game engine from scratch. Every
frame is drawn in 2D using Android's Canvas and SurfaceView APIs. I managed to
achieve nearly >55 FPS on average on a Nexus 5; newer devices should hit 60 FPS.

Features include:

  * Two player mode with multi-touch enabled to control both paddles at once
  * Single player mode against an automated/computer controlled opponent - choose which side you'd like to play on
  * Bonus balls added after enough volleys
  * Demo mode is computer vs computer - it's strangely mezmerizing to watch :)
