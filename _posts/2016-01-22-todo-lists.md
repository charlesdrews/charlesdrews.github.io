I built this simple to-do lists app as my first project for General Assembly's
Android development bootcamp. The goals for this project were to understand
the *Activity Lifecycle* and passing data between activities via *Intents*.

<div class="center-links">
    <a class="btn btn-md btn-outline github-project-link" href="https://github.com/charlesdrews/ToDo-Lists" target="_blank">
        <i class="fa fa-github"></i>
        <span class="small">View on GitHub</span>
    </a>
</div>

Features include:

  * Add, view, and delete lists
  * Edit the name of an existing list
  * Add, view, and delete items to/from any list
  * Edit all properties of an item, including moving it to a different list
