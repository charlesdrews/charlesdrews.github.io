### Natural Language Processing for Album Release Announcements
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool created for a school assignment.
The tool automatically extracts key information from press releases announcing the release of musical albums.
It was written in Java using the [Jet NLP toolkit](http://cs.nyu.edu/grishman/jet/jet.html).

### Network-on-a-Chip Topology Research Project
This is a research project created for a school assignment.
The project explores the optimal topology for interconnection circuitry between cores of a multicore, Network-on-a-Chip (NoC) processor for a given target application being executed on that NoC processor.
The code for the project was written in Python.
I also used the [Multi2Sim](http://www.multi2sim.org/) simulator to test my theoretical hardware topologies.
