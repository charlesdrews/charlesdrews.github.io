HUD, short for Heads-Up Display, is a quick info card app with news, a
to-do list, and a subway status widget. I built HUD with a team
of three other developers one week as part of General Assembly's Android
development bootcamp. The news headlines/links are pulled from the
[New York Times API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs){:target="_blank"}.

<div class="center-links">
    <a class="btn btn-md btn-outline github-project-link" href="https://github.com/charlesdrews/HUD" target="_blank">
        <i class="fa fa-github"></i>
        <span class="small">View on GitHub</span>
    </a>
</div>

My contributions:

 * Set up the *SyncAdapter* which refreshes web content at regular intervals and on swipe-to-refresh
 * Saved web data in a *SQLite* database and used a *ContentProvider* to notify *ContentObservers* to refresh the UI
 * Set up the *RecyclerView* to display news headlines and link to full article in browser on click
 * Built the to-do list feature which saves tasks via the *ContentProvider* then uses the *AlarmManger* to schedule an *IntentService* which launches a notification at the date/time selected by the user
 * Added an [MTA status widget](http://www.mta.info/mta-service-status-widget){:target="_blank"} in a *WebView* and modified the back button behavior to work with both the WebView and the Activity
