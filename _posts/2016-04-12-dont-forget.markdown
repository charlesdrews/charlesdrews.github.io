description: Don't Forget is an app that delivers weather, task, and birthday reminders to users via notifications custom-timed to fit their schedule. The app is very customizable thanks to a robust set of user-controlled preferences on the settings screen. You can check it out in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.charlesdrews.dontforget">Google Play Store</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/charlesdrews/Dont-Forget">GitHub</a>.<br><br>This project was a great opportunity to use some popular third-party libraries like Retrofit, Picasso, and Realm. It was also a good exercise in multithreaded, asynchronous programming, using a Sync Adapter to gather data from the Weather Underground API and Intent Services to schedule and launch notifications.
