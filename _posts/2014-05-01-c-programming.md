The emulator will interpret and execute assembly code written in a simplified subset of the x86 assembly language.

### Virtual Machine Profiler
This project is a virtual machine profiler written in C for a school assignment.
The profiler generates basic block profiles and a control flow graph from a target application's instruction address stream.
It is intended as a demonstration of a profiling feature that could be added to a hypothetical virtual machine manager.
